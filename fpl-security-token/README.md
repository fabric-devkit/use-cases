# Context

A company call `Fox Private Limited (FPL)` plans to go public but is currently awaiting approval from the regulator (known as the `Financial Regulator`) to list its shares.  In the meantime, `FPL` has decided to issue security tokens in lieu of the listings of it shares. When `FPL` shares are publicly listed, `FPL` security tokens can be exchanged for shares on a one-to-one basis and tokens will not be created.

FPL plans to issue 1000 shares on initial listing, of which 10 shares is to be allocated to `Mr Fox`, the owner of the `FPL`. The rest of the shares are to be held by `FPL` itself. On some future date, let's call it, (L) date, `FPL` shares are listed in the market. 

Fifty days (L-50) prior to the listing, FPL created tokens. The total number of tokens issued will be exactly the number of shares to be listed. On L-50, `FPL` starts selling its tokens to the public via its website. Any member of the public can buy newly minted token directly from `FPL`. `Paul`, an investor bought 1 token from `FPL` directly when the token was issued on L-50.

An exchange, named the `Exchange`, a separate organisation from `FPL`, has been designated as the authorised organisation to enable investors of `FPL`'s token to buy/sell to each other but not to non-holders of `FPL` tokens. The `Exchange` is not permitted to mint new token and can only facilitate trades in token. On L-49, `Mr Fox` offload 1 token to `John` and, in effect, promise to sell one of his own FPL shares on listing date L to `John`.

On L day itself, no token is minted. Investors who bought token direcly from FPL can claim shares directly from FPL unassigned pool. Any unsold tokens will be removed from circulation. At the point of listing the total numbers of tokens (sold and unsold) in circulation will not exceed the total number of shares listed in the stock market.
