# Introduction

This repository contains descriptions of use cases for you to target your blockchain based implementation. 

Use any blockchain protocol to create your solution to fulfil the use cases mentioned in this repository. When you have created your solution, ask one of the owners of the organisation to create a project repository for you. However, if you prefer to work on your own repository, contact one of the owners of the `workingwithblockchain` to update the use case with a reverse link to your implementation.
